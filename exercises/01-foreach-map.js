//  1. Loop through the states array and print a string that says "{Capital city} is the capital of {state}."

// 2. Loop through the states and add a new property called "country" with a value of "USA" to each state object. Print the states after to make sure it worked.

// 3. Create a new array with just the state names.

// 4. Use the art data to create a new array with objects that contain just two keys: the title of the piece and the artistName.
// { title: "Study for \"An Aragonese Smuggler\"", artistName: "William Turner Dannat"}
